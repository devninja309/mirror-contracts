# Mirror Protocol Contracts

This repository contains the smart contracts that implement Mirror Protocol on Terra.

## Contracts

| Name                                               | Description |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| [`mirror_collector`](./contracts/mirror_collector) |             |
| [`mirror_factory`](./contracts/mirror_factory)     |             |
| [`mirror_gov`](./contracts/mirror_gov)             |             |
| [`mirror_mint`](./contracts/mirror_mint)           |             |
| [`mirror_oracle`](./contracts/mirror_oracle)       |             |
| [`mirror_staking`](./contracts/mirror_staking)     |             |

## Organization

- `artifacts/`:
  - `checksums.txt`: hashes to check for tampering
  - `mirror_<contract>.wasm`: compiled contract WASM binary
- `contracts/`:
  - `mirror_<contract>/`: contract source code directory
- `packages/`:
  - `uniswap/`: bundled Uniswap-clone dependency

## Development

### Environment Setup

- Rust v1.44.1+
- `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
- Docker

1. Install `rustup` via https://rustup.rs/

2. Run the following:

```sh
rustup default stable
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

3. Make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is installed

### Unit / Integration Tests

Each contract contains Rust unit and integration tests embedded within the contract source directories. You can run:

```sh
cargo unit-test
cargo integration-test
```

### Compiling

After making sure tests pass, you can compile each contract with the following:

```sh
RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-s' cargo wasm
cp ../../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cw1_subkeys.wasm .
ls -l cw1_subkeys.wasm
sha256sum cw1_subkeys.wasm
```

#### Production

For production builds, run the following:

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/code \
  --mount type=volume,source="$(basename "$(pwd)")_cache",target=/code/target \
  --mount type=volume,source=registry_cache,target=/usr/local/cargo/registry \
  cosmwasm/workspace-optimizer:0.10.2
```

This performs several optimizations which can significantly reduce the final size of the contract binaries, which will be available inside the `artifacts/` directory.
